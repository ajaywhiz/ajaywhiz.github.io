                                    to live in Kalyan. His queen, a clever and political party follower, appointed him
                                    to govern some province. They had three

                                    The growing power of the Kalachuri and Ganapati kings and the successful rise of the
                                    mighty Ballala Hoysala kingdom of Mysore eclipsed the Chalukya power of Kalyan. For
                                    some time Mayur Varma, the Kadamba king of Panchugal, fought bravely and supported
                                    him. But many Mandalik kings quarreled with each other, the Kalpuri king became
                                    strong and weakened the Chalukya power by dishonesty. They had two sons Jagdev and
                                    Kamalvarti Trilokimal.
                                    Jagpekamalnh succeeded Somesvara and influenced the Kakatiya king Jagadi Kesari
                                    alias Prol of Warangal. Hessel of Mysore rode on him. He conquered Belapur. He died
                                    childless and was succeeded by his brother Telbadeva.
                                    The successor of Telbhadeva was the Kadamba king Sivachat alias Parachi of Goa who
                                    was the commander of Kolhapur. He captured Telab and himself became the king of
                                    Magadha Dhiraja PadiARI Vijayaditya Shikhara Pandava Siddayatha Vadil Adi Raje.
                                    Bijal Kalchuritha established his own independent kingdom by taking the reins of
                                    Telebdeva.

                                    Capital was kept at Kalyan. The capital was shifted to Alamgiri for a few days. She
                                    again brought Kalyana with Telang's release. Warangal king Jamati Kewari defeated
                                    Tele king. He died at that time.
                                    Telparai's son Someshwar succeeded his father. They are also called Tribhuvan and
                                    Virsomeshwar. He was the last ruling king of the Chalukya dynasty. The northern
                                    parts of the Chalukya Empire were captured by the Yadavas of Devagiri and the
                                    southern part by Ballal Hoybal of Baras Murch. Bamha, the commander of Someshwar,
                                    the great warrior, rode on the Kalasuri king and recovered some of his king's
                                    territory, but could not regain Kalyan. Capital made Dharampur.
                                    After Somesvara, his son Telap and his successor Chandradeva tried to gain the
                                    former kingdom with the help of their Konkan Karnataka brothers Bhauband and Soyre,
                                    but their predecessor Mandalik kings extended their power to the kingdom. The
                                    Chalukyas began to decline rapidly. As the elder son of Chandradeva, Ayyandeva of
                                    Vditya Chalukya dynasty and Banki Deva, the seventh sub-branch, he got the right of
                                    heir to Telepadeva.

                                    As there was no chance of becoming an independent king for Udhya Deva's family,
                                    Ajusoran Chandradeva accepted him as a feudatory. Further Vigal Paran's reign at
                                    Kalyan did not last long. He was murdered by Basavapar, the founder of Lingayat
                                    religion. He returned to Kalyan, Someshwar Chalukya for a few days but did not last
                                    long. Later, the name of the congregation in this family was created by Nirman state
                                    founder Yadav and Mandalik, who were followers of the previous Chalukyas, and
                                    treated him with respect by maintaining their relationship with Wari. Aiyan
                                    Viditya's descendants are the Chalukya descendants of the elder branch of Kalyan,
                                    and according to ancient tradition, they too were to re-establish an independent
                                    state.
                                    Even when it was clear that when there was a revolution in this area, the men of
                                    this family would be killed so that the men of this family would not try to
                                    establish an empire again. This is a special feature of this family that the men of
                                    this family were able to maintain the unique belief of their family with self-effort
                                    and nobility.
