                            A successful attempt was made between 1287 and 1285 to oust the Muslim power from Konkan by uniting the small kingdoms of Konkan. His maternal uncle Rudrarai Palavi was a general. After the death of Govindeva, his son Virstrashreya and his brothers were expelled from Sangameshwar by Rudra Raja and rebelled. But later in 1358, Virstrashreya and his brothers from Konkan joined forces with the help of Tukdev, the son of Kondibadeva, who was entitled to the senior family of Kalyani. Alauddin married the beautiful daughter of Palvi and named her Tongue Hara. Virastreyasreya was given the rights of this family in the area of Sangameshwar Bankapur village etc., he started looking after the affairs of this land independently as the representative of his father's family and the documents show that Tukdev being ignorant also looked after the land for his welfare.

                            Therefore, the campaign against these two kings was blackened with their army. Shukadevdha's son Katiyardev and Nanovadev's son Vijaydev were involved in this campaign. With his help, he made a treaty with the king of Warangun. Veerpaujula had done Vijayadeva's brotherhood at Bankapur. His gills sprung into it. He also regained his homeland in Bankapur and Konkan.
