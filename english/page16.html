                            At that time Shivaji fought from the Mughals. His brother-in-law Ramaji Jadhav through Ramji in Adilshah's army raided for Kalyan's homeland. Ramaji Jadhav was fighting bravely and suddenly he was shot dead. Ramaji Jadhav's Lekas Raiba and Tikodi were given to Adil
Shah as some villages in Harewad Kunur in the surrounding area. Ramji's archaic death Mokasa has returned. Adilshahs Gowalkondia was helped by Qutbshah and Jai Singh, the famous general of the Mughals, started to lose. Again he conspired to bring Shivaji and the emperor to meet. Because Shivaji, through Ramji's brother-in-law, informed the Hindu Nayaks in Karnataka to help Adil Shah, the Moghals noticed the internal intrigue. Diler Khan complained that Shivaji could not even build Parnala fort. Shivaji understood that the Moghals' plan was to double down on the Moghals and keep their promises in time of emergency to destroy all three of their enemies in the south. Shivaji devised a plan to defeat the Mughals by defeating the Shah of Bijapur Gowalkonda as Jai Singh had such a doubt, he wisely diverted Shivaji to Mogla and defeated him in Bogla, where Aurangzeb treated Shivaji with honor and made him a Panch Hazari Mansabdar of Tyang Hala status.

                            Shivaji was asked to salute the king to please the king, but the king ignored him. At that time, Shivaji treated him as a single-minded tax collector of the rank of jagirdar. Shivaji signed a treaty to give 33 forts to the Mughals and went late to meet the Emperor. Since he had only 12 forts and Muluks left in his possession, it was impossible to give him more respect than the Mughals' big Mansabdars. As Jaswant Singh did not stand up and did not show up, Shivaji turned red with anger, turned his back to the throne and left the court in anger, he did not meet the emperor again. When Shivaji conspired with Adil Shah and Qutub Shah to defeat the Mughals, he trusted Jai Singh and had to suffer great humiliation by being tricked into coming to see the emperor. Ramji would not have advised him about the fire place and Mouni Bua had also kept silent and had not given clear blessings. By trusting that Jaisingh's sweet heart was tendered to his pain, he regretted taking a great risk in maintaining Jaisingh's honor, but he did not show his objection. The servant Chakarat, who accompanied
him, started the business of getting rid of himself and Sambhaji by showing his amazing skills and sending the army back. NOTAR

                            Pretending to be ill, he kept selected faithful brave servants and friends to advise him on the next path, Ramji's nephew Raghoji used to come frequently with his cousin Bhojraj for pilgrimages to Uttara Tirtha and Mogla's work. Shivaji had taken his help from Ramji's advice. A valuable performance by both of them to be done Shivajira Raghoji secretly reached Varanasi with the help of Brahmin Santra's soldiers. Bhoja Raja kept with Sambhaji. Bhoja Raja's relationship with many Hindu royal umraos, his family, a son, a daughter, the niece of Rajput Mhadram Singh of Malwa, that same Rajput Vitra, as the Moghals were given a loan from Swari in the south, Gumastarah Usulira from the Mahanta used to wander north. For such reasons, Amol helped Raghoji and Bhojraj to return safely to Shivaji and Sambhaji in the south by concealing the suspicions of the Mughals. Shivaji was happy. Ramjira Samadhaar has been raided. Sane strengthened Ramaprasan. Later Ramji got the help of Marathas from Konkan to defeat Shivajis Konda. At this time, when there was a drought, as the supply of food was scarce, Shivaji's hunger strike was very successful. Shivaji extended Mounibuva's darshan OTAR with Ramji staying at Patgaon. Made friendship with Portuguese Firangya and Sawant. To build Sindhudurga near Malvan *

                            At this time advised to ride on the Karnataka Pratas. Further, in 1529, before Shivaji left for Kantak, he met Qutb Shaha at Bhaganagar after receiving the blessing of Mouni Bua and his relatives Shivaji granted Mouni Bua's long-lasting performance as a saint. Mukundrao was at loggerheads with Qutub Shah's vizier Mir Ziaullah. Because Mukundarawaye Aja Se Ramvi Balauy is a warrior and a diplomat and since the natives of Chaludan families are entitled to the land there, Ramji's Aja Savaji and his father Khadoji and their son Ramayi helped
Apulki with the spirit of Apulki. Mukunda Rao used to love like a son. He was given a share of his land and made entitled to war. He is the leader of Hindu Umrao in Kanadi region and as a warrior of Pundai reputation, Qutb Shah gave him the important task of keeping his vizier in check. The relationship between Ramji and Shivaji became stronger when they stayed at Pathgaon. He who used to serve his Kunt brothers to Gowalkonda and Mughals. Informed him to help Shivaji secretly, Shivaji promised to continue his rights in Swasanthan. During Shivaji's second kingdom Abhishek, Ramjit was injured by a special invitation.
