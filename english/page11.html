                            Rayas was satisfied with the destruction of the forts of Solapur and Kalyan, Kamalojis was given full rights to Kalyan and he settled in Kalyan, the people there call him Namobadev. He was married to Saraswati Devi, daughter of Sindhyadhi of Torangal. He had three sons Maghoji, Tukoji and Hemoji. Maghoji was married to Subhagyavati, daughter of Vidyoji Moje Gole (Gol) Ambadkar. As the Gondani revolted in the Mal country and began to behave independently, they were called by big names, like Rathod Umrayas, he was nicknamed Ghatge because he saw the Bahmani sultan down in the water and broke the bet on the bells hanging above, Te Raje Kushal Tene. In the
year 1476 Mang Sawta rebelled in Konkan and seized the antiquities belonging to this family in Chandwad, Kudal, Sangameshwar. Kamaloji was involved in the politics of Vijayanagara.

                            The tension flared up. Adilshah's chief Mir Ali tricked him and killed him in 1550. Then the batan is swallowed. Muhammad Adilshah marched to capture Tikri fort and stayed at Bankapur. As a man of this family gave him twenty twenty five rupees in aid, Adil Shah promised to return the rights of the fort of Bankapur. Amal did not return, when Adil Shah came to Bankapur under the influence of the Mughals, he got his homeland back. A major revolution took place in the south from 1465 to 1488. At that time King Krishnadev of Vijayanagara died. Sadashiva Rai became the nominal king. Power passed into the hands of his three brothers, the Bahmani king also became five. Among them, Ahmednagar, Govalkonda and Vaijapur were powerful and powerful. They also had frequent fights with each other. The king of Vijayanagar took advantage of them. The Nizamshahs of Ahmednagar once helped the Adilshahs of Bijapur and seized the Budhdal area of Raipur. By weakening the Muslim sultans and expanding the Vijayanagar empire, the two chieftains of Adil Shah of Bijapur, Umrao Belgaon, Asad Khan and Aujul Mulukh, rebelled. Agreed with the Portuguese Firangi Bansi,
the Firangis helped with the intention of expanding their kingdom. Sahebzada Abdullah of Bijapur, with the intention of getting the kingdom of Bijapur, defeated Abdullah in 1447 and announced the name of Adilshah of Bijapur. Sadashiv by Ibrahim Shah let's modify them with Raya's help. Ibrahim Adil Shah attacked Sashti and Bardej. Again the Firangis regained it. In the following year, Ibrahim became a prophet.

                            Baris Ali Adilshah went to Vijayanagar and met Ravas and befriended him. He also befriended Hussain Nizamshah. But they did not see the benefit of it. Again mutual conflicts arose, so the antiquity of this Chalukya dynasty spread to all the above three Balakaya kingdoms. They suffered a lot. Kalyani used to sleep here in order to cultivate his Kamalogji. They had to take part from the Muslim sultans. His Shahibandara had to fight against the Rai of Vijayanagara. In 1480 CE, Adilshah with the help of Sadashivarao rode out with the intention of recapturing Solapur and Kalyani forts from Bunhan Nizamshah. The Nizamshah became a Pura mode. Jahangir Khanas killed. Kalyani should be returned to Adilshah. Hussain met Nizamshahs, Sadashiv Raya and had a mujra. At that time Hussain Shah took Raya's hand in hand. Hussain got angry. He asked for water to wash his hands. At that Sadashivraya angrily exclaimed that Hussain Shah, a great guest, would have broken his hands otherwise. Raya also washed his hands. Both of them had a lot of quarrels. The color of Tahnama breaking started to appear. Kamaloji and his cousin Timoji were near Rai. He promptly settled their quarrels with wisdom and grace. Buhanshah showed the key of Kalyani Fort to Sadashiv Raya. Sadashiv Raya took a promise from Ibrahim Shah to maintain the rightful Dastur Kamlogis lineage of Kalyani Fort. Kamalojis Nayak e- Nayak has been honored with the title of Bahumana. This book was willingly accepted by all the three Muslim Sultans and Rays, in 1483 CE Hussain Nizam Shah married his daughter Jamal Bibi to Ibrahim Qutub Shah at Kalyani. Kalyani fort was besieged. Ali Adilshah attacked his army with the
help of Sadashiv Rao. Kamaloji's cousin Timojirao was included in Sadashiva Raya's army. He came to work. Raya awarded the fort of Bankapur to Setangrao, son of Timojitha.

                            At this time, there was heavy untimely rain and there was a big flood in the river channels. Hundreds of guns in Hussain and Ibrahim Qutub Shah's army were submerged, raising the tide of prosperity. Adil Shah achieved a great victory with the help of Sadasiva Rao. Sadashiya Rai went mad with joy and he brutalized Karima, the entire Muslim Sultan Khawlile in the south, decided to settle their quarrels and take revenge on Raya. Solapur Fort was given to Ali Adil Shahas as dowry of Ghandbibi. Due to these reasons, the mutual fights and conflicts of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur Shahs were resolved. All the four Muslim Sultans under the leadership of Ibrahim Qutbshah laid a great siege on Vijayanagar in AD 1486-87. The forces assembled at Solapur and marched towards Talikot. A fierce battle took place at Rashtra Tagadi near Talikot. Vijayanagar was flooded. The Hindu empire was completely destroyed. Many Hindu warriors came to work. Kamaloji and his brothers Bankoji, Jotirao, Timoji's son Telangrao fought bravely and died. Due to these reasons, this family suffered a lot. Bankoji resided at Badami and Jyotiyaji at Pantagiri and Telangarai at Bakapur. At this time there were fratricidal fights in Konkan and the Sultan seized their lands. Adilshah Nizamul Mulak entrusted the antiquities of this family. So his heirs were forced to accept the Moglai Mansabdari at the invitation of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and try to regain their homeland.
