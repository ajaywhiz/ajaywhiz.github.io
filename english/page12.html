                            In 1495 CE, Adil Shah attacked Parwad, Bankapur. Kamaloji's son Maghoji Thikayat ordered to join this army but he did not join as he was also entitled to Bankapur. Therefore, the forts of Kalyani Badami and Tal Devadi Umaraj around Bijapur, Mokasa Sardeshmukhi Nadgond Pateli etc. Bhagoji's cousin Bapuji's sons Valprao and
Narsujirao and the power of Vijayanagara was destroyed in Nagana at Rathsatgadi and acted independently. He did not appreciate Adilshah. Adil Shah surrendered the fort of Bankapur due to lack of help from outside. Velya Rao came to work. The beautiful temple in the fort was destroyed. Adilshah in place of the temple. The foundation of Manidi was laid. Mahishasura Mardini's idol in the temple was broken and looted all the property. An old paper idol secretly carried away by the family members to safety was a huge precious sapphire Kona Pransi Firanga which was not required by the Sultan. After buying it, it was also torn and eaten by a dog. Bankapur was owned by this family for hundreds of years. Due to the curse of the goddess, Adilshah's kingdom was in disarray and in 1502 he became a childless Prophet. Eradat Khan, Shahjaha's Subhadar of the Deccan, with the help of Piloji Bhosla, met Magoji's son Sabaji Shahjahan and got Moghals. Sabaji allowed his fraternal children to join the Mughal army. Sabaji met Shah Jahan Emperor in 1552 and was his nephew

                            Sawantrao, Baghuji, Appaji Chulata Yenuji brother Bhikuji Mangoji Badamikar Rajuji, Rayaji, Naroji, Rairao were made Mansabdars of Moghal. In 1557, Savaj was honored with elephants and lions. As per the tradition of the family, Tikayata Sirbar Nazrana was excused. The servants decided to take their children, brothers, sisters, and dhoyers. When the emperor was tempted to grant Sabaji a great deal of honor to accept the job himself, he refused. Shahjaha Badshah wrote about Sabaji in Khudwat to the Shah of Iran. Its content is evident from the text. Since we got the right of Chalukya Kalyan of Sabaji Nayak, many Sardars from Deccan are joining our army, so we will make the entire Dakshina Ilakhyas Sarar. Sabaji was married to Nayaldevi, daughter of Yashwantrao More Chandrarao. Azam Khan invited Shahaji Bhosla, son of Jaghwa's son-in-law Maloji, and Hindoji, son of Sabaji, to leave the job of Nizamshah and join the Mughal army. Shahaji took the job of the Mughals. He met Azamshah with two horsemen. Shahani and Badshah gave a cash reward of five
thousand Mansab Jalau Jamghar Nagara, Nishan, elephants, horses and two lakhs of rupees. At this time Shahaji's Bhaibands also awarded three thousand, two thousand, one and a half thousand mansabi and eight hundred rupees according to their merit. Saguji got married to Bhagyavati, daughter of Krishnaji Maurya, with the presence of his royal sardar, according to Purana documents.

                            After a year or two, Shahaji Bhosalya became the Nizamshahara as he was at odds with the Mughal chieftains. The Mughals attacked it and drove it to Konkan. Nizamshah's Amir Mahaldar Khan Bapjati was the fort of the district. He visited Bevun Khan Banara at Qilla Kalna. They expressed their desire to get the Mughals if Bajati fort was given to them. Khan Khan Bolvita, Gahaji and Ranhulla are in Vaijapur because of their wives and we believe that if they are broken, Mahaldar Khan called his wife and children and presented four hundred horses, one and a half lakh rupees, twelve thousand hon etc. Khan Khan kept Shahaji's family in Kalnaki fort and informed Fattekhan through Khandoji. The emperor should give his forts and Daulatabadia forts in his possession to preserve the honor of Shahjis his wives and children. Daulatabad fort ran out of logistics, ammunition. As Lashkar Patti was ravaged by disease, the fort became difficult to attack, Khandoji's advice was to demolish the fort and free Shahaji's family. When the Emperor came to know this news, he was very happy. He wrote to the Shah of Iran. One thousand tofas worth two and a half crore rupees was received in this ride. Khandoji and his nephew Mokasa Batan Haqq restored the above performance in 1555 CE, in 1557 CE Mughals and Adilshah sent a large expedition to defeat Shahaji, Ranghola was wounded and sat down in Tuljapur. Shahaji Kisan descended the Ganga and bravely fought against the Khan Jamaan. Khan Zamana moved to Kolhapur and the interest of Yekuti Khandoji's brother-in-law in Miraj Raibat Lavity suffered a lot due to distance involved in the war from both sides.

                            Determined to compensate them by the Moguls, Khandoji's brother Ananda was Thanedar of Rajapur in the Konkan. Shahaji could not help Shahaji in 1568 due to the fear of the Mughals and Adil Shah's vast army, so Khandoji was unhappy with Ananda. The Mughals built the Digar fort. Nizam's relatives were imprisoned by Atabiridi Khan. As Shahaji decided to kill Ali Adilshah if he did not accept his service, Khandoji also boldly informed his brothers and relatives to join the campaign. Adilshahs were doubted and his right to land was denied. Nizamshahi, Mughals and Adil Shah should have destroyed them together. Shahaji took the job of Adilshah of Bijapur, Nizamshah's share of land went to Adilshah who belonged to Khandoji's family. The friendship of Shahaji and Khandoji became close. A famous mighty son like Khandojis Shahaji did not find it suitable to stay in Bijapur, so he urged Shahajis to undertake the expedition to Karnataka. The native of Khandoji's brother Ishta is from Karnataka province and Khanduji willingly took the task of getting Shahaji's help. Khanduji, the hero of Karnataka region, is a hero of Kalyani Bankapuraya, so he will respect him and with his advice, he opposed Shahaji and helped him to give Adilshah job. Shahajira did not receive regular help from the Mughals. Adil Shah's policy in Konkan 24 occurs repeatedly.
