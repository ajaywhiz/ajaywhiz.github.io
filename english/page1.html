Vijayaditya, a man of southern Chalukya origin, came in 143 AD with the intention of establishing an independent state in the south, with the intention of establishing a fraternal alliance with his half-brother Chitrakanth of Ayodhya. After staying for a few days at a village called Chapli near Maheshwar at Wattes Mode, he crossed the Narmada and stayed with his friends in the area near Ajanja, where the army assembled and started to move independently into the forest. At that time, a Bali Pallava king named Trilochana became a nuisance in the region and he took advantage of it and made his kingdom appear. Seeing his royal prowess, pious actions and bravery, the big and small kings and the barbarians helped him against the Kur king of Pallava dynasty. When Trilochanaya was chasing after him, he was suddenly struck by an arrow and his horse fell down. His pregnant wife, a cow named Mundivendra, took refuge with an ascetic Brahmin named Somayya.</p></div>
