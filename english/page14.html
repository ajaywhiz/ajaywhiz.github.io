                            Mustafa Khan Angroji Shahaji's Devaskari Shahjis Mustafa Khan arrested him with a mug from Banji Ghorpade, Khandoji showed great bravery in the encounter of Ukula. Khandoji was injured and stayed at Bankapur. Shahajira took Afzal Khan to Bijapur. On the way, Afzal Khan insulted Shahajit and said far. Khan was a Vdeshta Kur of evil Hindus. When Khandoji tried to release Shahaji through Muhammad Khan, Shivaji with the help of Mughals put pressure on Adilshah, after returning Sinhagad and Bangalore to Adilshahs and freeing Shahaji, Shahajit again rushed to the achievement of Karnataka province. Shahaji regained Adil Shah's trust. Bangalore was awarded to Shahajir with an income of five lakh hon, Muttradi Murar Jagdev and Ragulla Khan became Prophets in Shah's net, and Shahaji had great confidence
in Shahaji as it was difficult to stop Naika's number 35 in Karnataka due to lack of accomplished and mighty warriors like Shahaji. In order to protect Mustafa Khan from Shahaji's prosperity, Shah agreed with Qutb Shah and decided to divide Karnataka by both of them together. After a breakdown in partition negotiations escalated their enmity, Shahaji defeated Runhoji, his brother-in-law, Mir Ziaullah. Adilshah was pleased with Shahaji by recovering the expenses of the battle. Kanakigiri hero Apparao rebelled.

                            So Shah sought the help of Afzal Khanara Shahaji. Sambhaji Shahaji's son Sambhaji was killed in 1576 after Afzal Khan refused to help him. The following year Muhammad Adil Shah became a Prophet. In Bijapur, there were frequent fights. Shahaji, with the advice of Khandoji, had fully informed Jijabai and Shivaji about his ambitious policy. Looking at the time and situation, he decided to devise a strategy to carry out his work in neta, sometimes as Adilshah and sometimes as Qutbshahs and sometimes as Moglar. Shivaji took advantage of the abandonment of Bijapur and began to take over their territory, rebellion broke out again in Karnataka. As it was not settled, Adilshah himself could in 1885 Kadiveli, Shah's Umrao's expedition to Karnataka, papered about Shahaji and Khandoji. Khandoji advised him to quit the job of Shahaji and Bijapur and get Qutub Shahat. Khandoji's Bhaiband Mukund and Qutub Shah's senior Nami Bahadur Yopde, Mir Jumla's trusted official, Shahaji, were fit for the Hindu heroes of Karnataka, so Adil Shahs could not get enough success in Karnataka. Adil Shah arrested Shahjis at Bankapur for the second time due to such mischief. Khandoji was stationed at Bankapur and he immediately freed Adil Shahas Barchor Nayaks of Karnataka on the charge of land grabbing. NOTAR

                            Khandoji, with the help of Shahaji, conquered the Naikas of Karnataka. Adil Shah gave Khandoji's Thane of Kadami Masure in
Konkan along with thirteen villages to Sawant. Kadamrao, brother of Sawantrao, lived in Bankapur around 1558 CE. Mir Ali Reza, Adilshah's chieftain, was talking to him about the demand for Bankapur. The entire land was swallowed up and given to the Muslim Umravas, it fell in 1550. Mohammad Adilshah ordered Bankapur Mukkami Khan Khan to help him capture Tikri fort. At this time, Adil Shah was pleased with Khanduji's bravery and promised to continue with his former homeland, but this did not happen. Taking advantage of Adilshah's tussle, Shah Jah, the Mughal emperor of Hastinapur led by Shahzada Aurangzeb led a huge battle. By storming the fort of Bidar, the territory of 15 crores was captured. When Kariye was fighting against Kalyan, Khandoji and Chadni along with their Push brothers, Soyre and friends rushed to help Adilshah's reward. A fierce battle was fought. Seeing that the fort was not fortified, Aurangzeb tried unsuccessfully to capture the fort by bribing Tanaji, Kondaji's cousin. In support of the Mughals, Khandoji finally got the rights of Kalyan and gave it to the Mughals on the condition that the ancient temple in the fort be renovated. Aurangzeb's sympathy with the dynasty may be due to the name of Khandoji in 1568

                            A fierce encounter broke out between the Mughals and Bijapur commander Sher Khan near the village Khandaji. At that time, Khandoji's brother Bewlaji and Nanaji's army in the army of Adilshah abandoned Aurangzeb on the orders of Sher Khanadhya, so Sher Khan was beheaded at Bijapur. Mokas around Bijapurye of Khandoji was confiscated. His homeland in Konkan also made him forget. As it was advisable to get these lands back, they had to give help to the Mughals. It was decided to demolish the Kalyani fort through Nanaji's intervention, when Hawasi was fleeing after giving Adil Shah's reward, Khandoji's army caught him and sent him along with Nanaji to Aurangzeb through Mir Ziaullah. Aurangzeb sent them off with honor along with their wives and children. The attack of the Mughals began on the fort. Aurangzeb's Kalyani and Ramgarh fort were given as a
reward by Emperor Shah Jaha. Mowazzam Khan gave the fort and ancient rights of Kalyani to Mughal Sardar Mohammad instead of giving it to Khandoji's father and son Ramjis. The fort of Badami was given to Khandoji's brother Gurdoji. The Sardeshkat of Naiki in the Konkan province was granted to the Khandoji brothers with Sarpatilaki, and Sir Nadgowda's right to Bankapur was also granted. Shah Jah Badshah had to march due to rebellion in North India. So till then Alikwari promised to give the rights of Kalyani fort to Khandoji. Shivaji's establishment of self-government was started by Muttattadi Pana with great bravery and net by conquering many small and big forts when he was still young with great skill and skill.
