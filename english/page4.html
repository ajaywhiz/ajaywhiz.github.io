                           <strong> Part Second </strong><br/>
An account of the elder branch of the Chalukya dynasty, kings of Kalyan<br/>
Adhyandeva Viditya was married to Chandrikadevi, daughter of Rashtrakuta Krishnadeva. This Southern Chalukya is 31st in descent from Vijayaditya of Bansiya origin and 19th in descent from Pulakeshi Veditya Saptasriya. This Chalukya King Vikramaditya V's younger brother Sathabi was given to Kardiva Raja Shahdev Datta of Goa. He was stubborn from childhood. After Vikramaditya's 5th childless Vaikunthavasi ascended the throne. But when his step-younger brother Jai Singh, on the warning of his mother, demanded half of the kingdom, Ayyandeva willingly abdicated and gave the entire kingdom to him. Although his sister did not like this, God did not allow the kingdom to be divided into two parts.

                            Seventy villages of Kuravad and Saptapati were given to Akkadevi for the sustenance of Adhyan Deva. Ayyyandev stayed at Taddevadi for a few days and later stayed awake at Vikrampur, but he had a strong desire to study religious subjects in Akanthavamsa living in Akanta and study religious subjects. Staying at Yetagiri for a few days, he later stayed with his guru in a cave in the forest near the Tiraprapant lake built by Tolebdeva at Kalyani. His Guru Bharvadaj Gotri was a great extraordinary sadhu. He was a disciple of the Guru of Chalukya in Paravi state. Being in his company, he gave up his lust for royal glory and renounced his kingdom for a little while, so he is called a sage. Many legends are known about him. Adhyadeva had
announced to establish his capital at Devi Putlia. Accordingly, his nephew Someshwar increased its glory.

                            After increasing the glory, Vasyani was made the capital. It is evident from the flood documents. The fact that Adhyandeya was living in the cave of Kalyana, he became incarnated is mentioned in the following Sanskrit poetry.
One day, Adhyayan Dev Bharvadaj was discussing a religious matter with Swabhi when suddenly Ug gathered in the sky. Lightning flashed and hail and heavy rain began to fall. A gust of wind started blowing. Putting my head on the feet of Adhyandev Guru, I renounced the kingdom of Boli and followed devotion. I could not arrange for children because I did not want to rule. May the Lord provide us with all that we need with His blessings, my last wish is. May my descendants continue to do the work of protecting Nandun Dharma for as long as possible. Sthavara Swami says, it is difficult for the royal family of the empire to last forever, but if your descendants give up their desire for an independent kingdom, Amyandeva died as soon as he heard the goddess wish that your descendants would stay in Kalyan and serve Sanatan continuously.

                            Swabhini gave up her body after giving the above prophecy to her disciples, in Sakae 156 Vikrasamvat 1111, the news of Adhyandev's death came to his nephew Someshwar while he was erecting the victory column at Kokanpur. He returned to Kalyanara after reaching a village called Konkan and after performing the shastrayat kriya of Ayyandev went back to Svari. A king named Kotahat of the Kolhapur clan installed Yudhishthiya Sawant in 1978 saying that Ayyandev's chhatri is in Kalyani and is called Aktanadev in Kannada language.
Ayyandeva's sons Chandradeva, Apayakadeva, Kartikdeva and Narasingdeva and two daughters Mankidevi and Chattaldevi, Chandradeva was married to Akkadevi's son Toyamdeva Kadamba's daughter Rupmati. He lived in Chandragad. Apailadev lived at Udogiri in Somdi region. Katiyardev was married to Baratakttidevi, daughter of Senananda of Saudtavanshi. This is Sabajigad and lived in Bhudhargarh. As Narasimha Deva was married to a Shelarvanshi princess from Konkan, he lived in Sangameshwar.
