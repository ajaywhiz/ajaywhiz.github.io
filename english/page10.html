                            He broke the friendship with the Chalukya family and then Gaghoji's third son Sabaji Shivpati married the only daughter of Virumati Devi. Firangi Portuguese was present at the start of this. Due to this, Sabaji took the help of the Portuguese firanga and made a plan to conquer Goa through Timoji. Timoji lived as an armorial executor of the Raya of Vijayanagar. He is a great Putsadi Kavebaz warrior and Firangi was in trouble with the Portuguese Governor General Afojand Abtu Kar in negotiations, the people of Goa were under the torture of Tabhar. Sabajis used to earnestly demand to be freed from his tyranny. Tinoji befriended Firangya and through him organized a vigorous campaign. Goa being a natural harbor of excellent quality, the Portuguese firangi had the intention of taking it under their control. Adilshah of Bijapur was involved in the rebellion there and was unable to proceed against the fierce charge of the Firangis. Firangi Portugal had an ancient enmity with copper. The relationship of Timoji and Sabaji in Goa with the help of his wife, Goche was able to achieve success in just two days in 1432. Adilshah's Subhadar Malak fled.

                            The Hindus rejoiced at the capture of Sadashivgad and the capture of Talkokan by slaughtering the Muslims at Kudal. Alyu Karak paid great honor to Timoji, Ismail Adilshah of Bijapur replied to the Chidun Balauy military force in Konkan. The Portuguese firang fled Goa, the people of Irrawaddy under Sabaji revolted. Burdens Thanedar. Albu, Karkar came back with help from Savachi, assisted by Timoji and Savaj's son Malharrao launched a strong attack on Goa. Adilshah's generals Rasal Khan and Pulad Khan fought a close battle and Goa retreated. Timoji tried to take Goa to himself. He appointed Firangi Mahal Badacha as the Chief Vanedar. Goa was placed under Portuguese rule. Timoji decided to take Goa under the rule of the king of Vijayanagara and sought his help. As it did not happen, he called him to Vijayanagara and expressed his displeasure. To the people of
Goa as Timoji was an accountant, Nandan did not like to be under his rule. Adil Shah again invaded Goa in 1446 CE. After capturing the Konkan Gulf, Goa did not return to the government. The people of Goa complained to Firangya against Vimoji. Sabaji's son Malharrao was claimed by the hero. The Portuguese firangya arrived at Malharravas Hopja and went to Goa with great honor.

                            In 1465, the Firangyas with their help recovered Samti Ilakha from Adil Shaha. Matharrao was appointed Thanedar of Tis Bari Sahi and Bardej Mahal as the old Kabijdar. Later, when the Portuguese Satta was established and strengthened in Goa, he took away the power over these three mahals from his heirs and paid only Nand Laks Kujas per annum. This family's Puranic claim to Goa was forced to be approved by the end of the copper plate dated 1313. It is found from the Puranic documents of the Balukya dynasty that a copy of that copperplate and its Portuguese translation was in the Portuguese registry in 1454. In Saka 1462, Malharrawdha's son Bhujbalrao and then Tisha's second son Hamirrao succeeded. Since Hamirrao also had Sangameshwar and Itakha, there was a fraternal rift, so Kamoji and Appaji mediated and made Ashpaji's second son, Timojirao alias Bhojrao, the rightful owner of Batna from Goa. Taking advantage of this nepotism, the Firangis increased their cash payments. Timojirao also died. His son was Telangrao Bankapuras hence Kamaloji alias Vir Tukoji, son of Nanoba, was entitled to Goa. Hence one lakh by the Portuguese Firangi instead of Kurjad, he started paying only twenty five thousand. Because kamojis are elder From one lakh kurajas, twenty five thousand was used as a relation. Kalyani--------------------------------------------------------- (Continued from Page 21) Allauddin returned defeated in his attack on Devagiri. Krishna Raya VIII attacked again on the condition that he would surrender the state if he did not conquer Devagiri. Apart from that, Shankar Ramdev instead of Virmati made him munsabdar.

                            The mob of Vedhil Mahanta will commit crimes on the basis of the paper certificate, Roth and Gundikar Thanedar through Govekar Kirangyara were informed about the Barra rights from there. Therefore, the heirs of this family started getting this amount. Tukoji Sawant was killed in 1502 by Adilshah of Konkan Bijapur, because the Hindu Marathas were rebelling under his leadership in the Karnataka region. Tricked into a compromise, Tukojira invited his Sadi Umrai to Bijapur and did the same as above. Therefore, his younger brother Yemtrao alias Yemoji Khasad Natu Bhojrai was entitled to the land in Goa, he used to live in Bankapur and look after the land in Talkonkan. A complaint was made to Firangya through Sondikar as the fraternal feuds intensified and the clerks were suppressing the collection. Thanedar Sardesai of Istgaye Ashraya enjoys our proof that it is not upto the status. Bring friendship and practice these ancient practices. It should not be a problem to pay cash advance as per prior agreement. Let it not be forgotten that the Naikas of the Chalukya dynasty treated the Portuguese as Sarkabun Gove, which in any case has no other meaning than the ancient friendship of the place. In 1469 CE, Bunhan Nizamshah rode with the help of Ati Barid Shahas and Sadashivarai of Vidar. Kamoji's son Kamaloji joined his brother Ishtamitra,
