                            Due to this, the economy of this family was greatly reduced, and they had to do Gujar Basar, putting their burden on the Lord. The battle of Bhatwadi in 1546 CE was the height of Mughal bravery. Ain Ken Josh self-confidence was created in Hindu Marathas by Southernization. Shahaji was pleased with Khandoji's bravery and tried to bring him under the Nizamshahi. On the other hand, Khanduji showed a new front to Shahjis, bringing together the Hindu small cow chiefs and taking the leadership of Shahaji to free the entire Maharashtra and Karnataka from the tyranny of the Muslims. All of them were fed up with the Muslims, Shahaji's Bhaibands were the great mighty Sardars at the great command of Ahmadnagar. Even in
the Muslim government there were fights among themselves. As the discrimination between Deccans and foreigners had increased among them, some Muslim chieftains were also eager to get them. Within two or three years after the war of paddy growth, a new serious situation arose as the emperor of Delhi and his prince Malik Ambar Ibrahim Adilshah came to the Prophet. The sons and grandsons of Lakhuji Jadhavrao, a powerful chieftain in the south, were killed by the Nizamshah. This act created a deep resentment towards Hindu Muslim power. A terrible drought struck them prematurely. Taking advantage of this situation, one should be in someone's service with his consent, the southern Muslim Sardar Khan, Nizam Jaha Fateh Khan, worked secretly to exploit the ambitions and mutual enmity of Muhammad Khan.

                            Seeing the situation, they united under the leadership of Shahaji to protect Hinduism and if possible to establish Swarajya. The kingdom of Ahmednagar was destroyed in 1558 CE. Shahaji should conquer the Karnataka province and unite Govalkonda and Bijapur Shahaji to fight the Mughals. After giving the advice to Mutasti Diwan Muraj Jahan of Aditgah that Adilshah's military strength should be increased by giving proper additions to the unemployed army and Sardars of Ahmednagar, the following decision was made. Shahjis marched into Karnataka with a large army under the leadership of Randulla Khan. Shahaji achieved great success. A new enthusiasm arose among the Hindu chieftains and they began to act independently, and in 1579 A.D. Adilsha became a Prophet. His heirs quarreled over the right. Emperor Shah Jahan launched a major campaign against Bijapur under the leadership of Aurangzeb. By storming the fort of Digar, he gained 15 Kot Damaya Mulukh. The Mughal army marched and besieged Kalyani. Khandoji rushed with his son, Bhauband, Atpestha to defend the fort. How bravely fought. As Sabaji was a resident of Vaikunth, there was much increase in the fort of Kalyani in the name of Khandoji's son Ramji. But as Ye Samavi Adil
Shah restored his family's land rights, Khandoji carried out the defense of the fort with great wisdom and gallantry. A fierce battle ensued. The army of Bijapur attacked the Mughals from outside by deploying forces from Karnataka. It became difficult for the Mughals to get grass grains.

                            Pahan informed Badoji's cousin Nanaji that Khandoji would retain his purana watan rights as Faturi's failed attempt to divide Karimi by giving it to the Hindu umra was not enough for Karimi. It should also be approved not to elevate the old temple in the fort. Aurangzeb's sympathy for this policy may have been due to an encounter in 1568 between the Mughals and Bijapur general Sher Shah at Khandani Gaon named after Khandoji. At this time the army of Bijapur joined the army of Nanaji and Yesuji alias Gambhirrao Khandoji. When he bravely surrounded Aurangzeb, he released Mahnun Sher Shah Khan at Bijapur on the orders of Sher Khan. As Aurangzeb also promised to return some of Khandoji's land that had been deposited, he decided to demolish the Kalyani fort through the mediation of Nanaji. Then Dilawar Habshi, the general of Bijapur, was fleeing, Khandoji's army caught him and sent him along with Nanaji to Aurangzeb via Mirjaula. Aurangzeb allowed him to go to Bijapur with his Vegma. The Mughal Emperor sat on the fort. Aurangzebs Kalyani and Ramgarh fort were given as reward by the emperor. Khandoji's rights were assured to be preserved. Mowazzam Khan gave the fort of Kalyani to the Muhammadan Mughal Sardar without giving it to Khandoji's son Ramji. The fort of Badami was given to Khandoji's brother Rupoji, Khandoji's cousin Mangoji Venkatabatti became his heir.

                            As Aurangzeb promptly left for Delhi, Shahjaha promised to hand over the fortress of Kalyani on his return. Adil Shah was angry
with Khandoji. His homeland in Konkan was given to him in Shaka 1558/59 along with thirteen villages of Musare Thane. Sawantraoba brother Kadibarao came to Bankapur and Adilshah's Sardar Mir Ali came to Bankapur from Goa and demanded the rest of the money. The whole soil there can be swallowed. Khandoji faced a big crisis. It became difficult to make a living for his family. Sardeshkat Naiki Nadgonda a little old Mokasa Sir Patilki watne found it difficult to make a living. Shahaji Raja gave him faith. He was very unhappy because the Mughals did not give him the fort of Kamgarle Kalyani in the Karnataka region. But the temple in the fort was not built by the Gogals. Satisfied with this, Jeev Ramji was injured in the battle of Kalyan. Kamalji fought bravely. Shivaji started the task of establishing Swarajya with Devi Shokine Yai, even now in modern Marathi style, and destroyed important forts. Khandoji, on the advice of Shahaji, informed his children to join Shivaji completely in brotherhood. Suspecting that Shivraj was helping Adilshahara Shahaji, Mustafa Khan also made a complaint against Shahaji. Shah's heart was hurt. With the help of Khandoji's brother Sadoji, Gaddji had captured the Tanja region. By extending to Shahaji. Due to the success of the campaign in Karnataka, his Pakistan will sit in that area to Bengal
