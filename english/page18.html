                                    In 1625, Bhoj Raja would be attacked by Hastinapura in northern India. He became a
                                    close friend of Gopal Singh Chandrawat and his son Himmat Singh. In 1625, when Bhoj
                                    Raj ran to help him, he was wounded and sick with pain. It is evident from his
                                    written letter Vampavahara that his mutual intimacy improved and his love increased.
                                    When Orgjebadha Shahzada Akbar remained under the protection of Ramji in Konkan in
                                    the guise of a fakir, with the help of Ramji's dependents, Pratsiga secretly took
                                    help in the daring task of evacuating Shahzada from Malvan II to Rajapur in a
                                    Firanga ship. At this time Shahjadya presented Ramjis with two precious swords as a
                                    reward, one of which was the Samsher named Alamgir. Until today, the inheritance of
                                    this family was safe. Sambhaji was killed by the Mughals. All the Marathas were
                                    filled with anger. Best wishes to Rajaram and his familyKnowing that Ramjit needs
                                    someone's help to reach him safely, he went to Konkan Karnataka. Betuji Anandrao
                                    Hajnur Rao Mahadji Sidoji and others dared to do this precious feat secretly. Mogul
                                    Mutsadi was not impressed by his halbali. That's his. The Mughal Hindu chieftains in
                                    the north and the Firangi ambassadors in the Konkan were fitured and took up his
                                    abode.

                                    It is found from the documents that Ramji's nephew Vituji Ghelgi agreed with Vibabai
                                    to stay at the fort. Mahadji Sidoji and Baloji in the Karad Pathan valley around
                                    Satara were seen by King Rama pleased with his bravery to resume their ancient
                                    traditions. Santaji Ghorpade, the village of Wagapur on the top of Ramji's old
                                    homeland, forcibly seized it. She gave them back, Tarabai also trusted Ramji's
                                    Bhaiband and performed important feats in Konkan, Karnataka region. It is found from
                                    the document that she attended Ramji's grandson Barsha Ramayi caste and gave a gold
                                    chambu and as a donation. These objects are still safe in the dynasty, Tarabai
                                    issued decrees to continue her ancient rights cash assignment Badstur, which she had
                                    obtained with the help of Santaji, but later in the Bhaibandi conflict at Kolhapur
                                    Satara, the Peshwas usurped their Konkan anonymously from the ancient Batna of
                                    Karnataka. The ancestors of this family never claimed ownership of the Peshwas.
                                    Hyder Tipu, however, kept some of his ancient rights in Badami, Balkapur in
                                    Karnataka without taking a bad look. But when the Brahmin subedars of the Peshwas
                                    regained it, Malharrao Holkar promised to continue his two holdings in the east of
                                    Balkapur, but the Peshwas' Sardar Patvardhan i.e. treacherously usurped them. The
                                    tissue came into conflict. A large army of Peshwas was chased away. As soon as this
                                    family started losing weight in this area, Yenuji, son of Motebar and Labai Ramji,
                                    was married to Parvatibai, daughter of Prabhugaonkar of Malusare. Yemoji's son Veer
                                    Vishnu was married to Krishna More Jamblikar's daughter Kamaladevi. Veer Vishnu's
                                    son Kamaloji was married to Bankuji Shinde Torgalkar's daughter Radhabai.

                                    Telepji alias Rudroji was married to Chandojirao More's daughter Mahadevi and the
                                    second marriage was to Suryaji Satna Sardesai's daughter Virubai. But at the same
                                    time Peshwas did by the British, the Peshwas merged the Yadarav family's village of
                                    Uraya Vatan, Mokasa Anandrao Patwardhan in the Jahagiri, Umbriz settled in 1747,
                                    Chinchujikar Patwardhan made a strong attack with the help of the British. From
                                    Solapur, the British called for fresh troops with cannons. Rudraji's son Sukdev and
                                    his wife Akkadevi fought bravely and reached the ear. Their umbrellas are still
                                    there. As Rudroji was completely defeated, he along with his five-six-year-old
                                    grandson Appaji hid in lower Konkan under the protection of Bhaiband and relatives.
                                    His Kalyani, Bankapur and Badshahi Mansabdari rights in Moghlai were difficult to
                                    obtain. The Nizam refused to implement the imperial decree of Astal Sanada. The
                                    British also confiscated their Mokasa Sardeshkat Nike Nadgounda rights. A huge
                                    reward has been announced for the person who captures him and his Barasas. Due to
                                    these reasons, the family suffered great loss and became very miserable, what can be
                                    described. As above, the proof paper copied by
                                    Appaji from the old Bakhar is worn and torn and some words are difficult and
                                    unintelligible. The part of the second goat was written in abbreviated form as
                                    follows.

                                    Kalyani from Mughals, fort rights of Bankapur, Mokasa, Sardeshkat, Naiki, Nadgowda
                                    Sarpatilki watne Bataji Tardevli Umbarj from Karnataka as a charter to drive
                                    Uttampusha from Rudrojipaveto to the male of this family was granted by inheritance
                                    from Sabaji to Rudrojipaveto by Nizam of Hyderabad, the southern subhedar of
                                    Mughals. Yamji did not give the usufruct of the aforesaid land to his son Vishnu,
                                    his son Naroji. But due to Maratha Nizam Hyder Akhu fighting in the south, their
                                    Kadami lands will remain under the control of Marathas and sometimes Nizams.
                                    Carnatic Batani frequents under Haider Tipu's Amla. These reasons are due to the
                                    legacy of this family damaged. The Nizam repaired the Kalyani fort in 1717 A.D. and
                                    kept his Janankhana safe, fearing an attack by the Marathas. The property in the
                                    fort of the Haya family belonged to Umbharaj. Temple servants in the fort, priests
                                    kept clerks for the Pujari's puja. But the Nizam's squires killed him by raising a
                                    strong cordon. Bhujadevi's jewel-encrusted statue of Bhujadevi, which adorned the
                                    building of the old temple, was broken. Temple and Idol Revenue Mughal Emperor
                                    Aurangzeb had promised to protect the Kalyani government from the time of 1576, but
                                    the Nizam recklessly destroyed the idol and destroyed his promise.
