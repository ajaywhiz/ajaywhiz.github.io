His son Telpadeva Sya's queen Lakshmi Devi was called Jalal Devi. She is the daughter of a Rashtrakuta king named Karka. He regained the kingdom of his ancestors, re-established the Chalukya dynasty after two hundred years and assumed the title of Vikramaditya and announced the establishment of his independent kingdom in 896 Srimukhnam Samvatsare. By stratagem and prowess he regained his ancestral kingdom of Lata and Gujarat and began to rule there independently. His nephew Awazi Verma's daughter Nehaldevi Highe was married to Hopya Rajatha Surraja. So he gave them good help to get back the state.</p></div>
