Someshwar was a mighty strategist. He was Mahamandaleshwar of Konkan Karnataka. He fought against Mahadev Yadav of Devgiri with the help of the king of Konkan. As Yadav's army was vast, he was defeated. He drowned in the sea while going to Gomya, Sirbhadreshwar's wife was Rudravashi, the daughter of the Telanganadha king Ganapati. Ganapati Raja and two daughters had no son. So he insisted on becoming Dirabhadra Ishwar and his heir. But he rejected the promise of his ancestors.
