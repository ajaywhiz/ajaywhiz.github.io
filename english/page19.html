                                    Rudroji, the heir of this family, complained to Sarkar Bahadur, the heir of this
                                    family, that half of the gold and jewels had been swallowed. As the Nizam showed
                                    indifference, the complaint continued to drag on. The Brahmin Peshwa of Satarakar
                                    tried to seize Umbaraj and Mokasa as the wife and children of Nizam Ramchandra Rao
                                    Jadhav Chandrasen, the son of Nizam's Maratha Sardar Nayak, were sheltered at
                                    Umbaraj. But in the beginning, the company
                                    government advised them not to interfere with the ancient land rights of this
                                    family, so some of the lands in the vicinity of Bijapur were handed over to the
                                    heirs of this family such as Mokasa Sardeshkat Naiki Sarpatilki. But the Peshwa's
                                    Bhat Sardar Patwardhan destroyed the Sringeri Math and swallowed the wealth of
                                    crores of rupees. At that time, the men of this family protected Shankaracharya by
                                    taking the advice of the aptesthas from Karnataka, so the Peshwa Sardar got angry
                                    and confiscated the land rights of this family at Bankapur. More than the damage
                                    done by the Nizam and Kekku Muslim Nababa, the Brahmin Peshwas brought a terrible
                                    crisis on this family by confiscating the land of this family in Konkan Phata,
                                    Karnataka etc. and giving it to someone else. In 1739, the men of this family helped
                                    Colonel Munroyas, an official of the Company Government, to resist the Peshwas in
                                    making the fort. He continued some of the Sardeshkatis here, with respect to the
                                    heirs of the family, which may have continued in 1766 when the Mokasa, Sarpatilaki,
                                    Hayak of Paveto Umbarj were destroyed. When the Rudrojis Company was offered
                                    first-class chieftaincy by the government and instead of Bombay, Madras, Konkan,
                                    Karnataka, near Bijapur, they refused it.

                                    The Peshwas gave their land to Sardar Patwardhan by force and created a controversy.
                                    At that time, the ducks of this family bribed the Muslim maidservant and other
                                    caretakers and swallowed the antiquities of this family. They rebelled against
                                    Patvardhan and the British everyday by considering the above reasons. In 1747, after
                                    the battle with the English, Appaji, the grandson of Rudroji, hid in Pathagaon Khona
                                    in Navale village near Bhughargad and Sangameshwar area in Talkonkan and started
                                    living under the protection of distant brothers and relatives. Fed up, he joined the
                                    Bhughargad fort revolt of 1766 and fought bravely. Shitafi reached the banks of Dudh
                                    Ganga river at Hunugati from the corner of Kalyani Sarkar of Satara. The rebels
                                    allowed the company government's army to advance one kos daily from Kolhapur. Seeing
                                    his bravery, Firangi
                                    Lapkar was shocked. But due to the large army and heavy cannon fire, they were
                                    defeated and left the official who was caught unawares. But after negotiation by the
                                    Company Government, some minor rights and lands were restored to Appaji's brothers
                                    and relatives according to the Tahnama of Hinderwadi, but the main heir of this
                                    family had to lose their ancestral lands forever. The surprising thing is that
                                    Khandan Kalyan's Mahant survived till date with the help of Berad Raja and Bhauband
                                    of Solapur. By changing the names of the heirs in this family, the heirs of the main
                                    patrimonial rights of the brothers and sisters to recover their rights, lawsuits and
                                    lawsuits continue to be a continuous enterprise.

                                    In Many cases of document corruption are observed daily. It would be appropriate to
                                    summarize some important observations and try to take them as they are. It is hoped
                                    that if there are any mistakes found in the writing such as some pages are torn,
                                    some articles are missing, difficult words, unclear syntax, etc. Many men and heirs
                                    of this family have copied documents, bakhari, articles, charters, decrees etc.
                                    Mahant, Purohit, Vishwagu, Chakar, Dhanik Savakar, Apteshta have Chahla for
                                    protection from the sifting of their portfolios. It has also been seen that many
                                    documents of complaint application against the Peshwa Patwardhan of Pune and the
                                    Nizam of Hyderabad against the Company Government have been collected and recorded
                                    serially by the Mahant of Kalyani and his friends from Karnataka.

                                    In this work, it is found that Appa Nayak Deshpande and Kulkarni Grahasthas were
                                    kept safe in the Mahant's Math of Kalyan with the help of the congregants of the
                                    Kanekar family and Deshpande Mahajan of Vikrampur in Karnataka. But the mahant's
                                    family quarreled with each other, due to the conflict, some records went missing and
                                    many families were destroyed and it is difficult to mobilize them, however,
                                    Rudroji's grandson Appaji, who was the
                                    special heir of the original family, kept his original name secret for fear of the
                                    company government and called his family's brother Sarnobat, the heir of the fort,
                                    and called his inheritance, Ture Mokasa, Sardeshkat, Nadgounda, Sarpatilaki, Naiki
                                    etc. are found to have been continuously engaged in mining industry. Authentic
                                    decrees of Mughal Ali Adilshah, Shahaji, Shivaji etc. along with very important
                                    documents and some copies were available. In this family, the rest of the ancient
                                    heritage historical tools were also opened. But this task is difficult to carry out
                                    without the help of many learned linguists, intelligent, honest planets with great
                                    expense and effort. However, who says that the pride of the family, the hard work
                                    done by the heirs of this family is not appreciable, considering the deteriorated
                                    situation under further repair, they put a little special surprise from their loyal
                                    and faithful servant. This brief Kaifiyat was prepared on the orders of Rajnaiki
                                    Nayak Appajirao on the basis of authentic documents based on the accounts of men of
                                    this family and their Bhat Purohit.
