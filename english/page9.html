                            His son Narsoji lived in Kalyani. Naroba Dev, son of Skandadev, along with Mahadev, son of Naroba Dev, lived in Badamis. On the advice of King Bidkandev of Bedgaon, he tried to recover Goa and Lower Konkan (Sapta Konkan) from him with the help of the elder Devaraya of Vijayanagar. As Bamani destroyed the voice of Shah, Bamani also took the Muhammad army himself with Muhammad Gavanyan and launched a campaign in Konkan. Besieged Belgaum. Unable to get the help of Vijayanagara, he could not fight him for long. Bilkan Dev was captured along with his mother and children. When his mother died and left him alive, Belgaum was given Batur jagir to Muhammad Gawan. After two consecutive years in the south, the sultan returned as Patti one, recapturing Kamloji's homeland. With the help of Kamaloji and Tyaba brother Maghoji Raya, he regained some lands in Konkan Karnataka. Between the Amirs of Bamani State, the two sides, Deccani and Pardeshi, came to a standstill. Taking advantage of it, the two brothers made a splash in Konkan. Yusuf Adilshah taken together, when Yusuf Adil was summoned by Bamni Sultan to quell the rebellion, he himself appeared. But the army did not come. Mahapada's thought was to go to Gowira. But as the Raya of Vijayanagar was attacking Satije Gotha between Kamaloji and
Madhoji, he returned to Didal in Saka 1403 and became a resident of Pangbar in 1403.

                            A rebellion broke out in Bamani state and it was made into five independent states. Narasuji died in Shaka 1417: Maghoji also became a Vaikunthavasi after him. But his children were grown up. She used to live in Balkapur and Sangameshwar. Narsuji was married to Bhagoji Gond Ambarkar's daughter Chandrakumari and they had four sons, Somaji, Kanoji, Appaji, Chimaji alias Bhagoji and a daughter Mahadevi. Maghoji and his four sons, Naroji, Telbarao, Sabaji and Timoji (Lekhawada), after the death of their father, Narsuji, a cousin of the Kalyani branch, took care of their children's ancestral rights. But since it was a feudatory of the Bijapur kingdom, it was difficult to keep the lands under Muslim rule safe. Virstatreya was kept in Kalyani and organized there, but Tolavkar became a nuisance in that area. He served in battle in 1427. As he had no children, Kanoji became the main beneficiary of welfare. He started living in Bankapur. He placed his younger brother Appajis Kalyanis, Kanoji was married to Kasturidevi, daughter of Bajirao Maurya. All of them together made repeated attempts to reclaim the land in Konkan. But the kings of Vijayanagara, Raj Bahadur and Virupaksha of this time were weak and of a tender age and did not get help from them. Vijayanagar was not well armed either.

                            It was difficult to take a village without armor. Kamodi's cousin Sabaji and Vamoji conquered Goa in 1432 CE with their help from the Firangi Portuguese. But the Firangis dishonestly kept it to themselves. However, the Kanojis agreed to provide three hundred Arab horses annually. Kanoji was a virtuous and virtuous man. His brother Appaji Nami Shur was a fighter. He was his advocate to the King of Vijayanagar and Kanoji at Bankapur before the Portuguese came to govern Goa was sent On the road to Bankapur and Vijayanagar was
the site of a magnificent fort. Kanoji had a troop of horses stationed near him and ruled independently. He was a Mandalik feudatory of the Raja of Vijayanagara. But because of the ancestral connections of his family, the Raja of Vijayanagar had protected him with honor and respect, and he did not suffer much from the Adilshah of Bijapur. In 1465 CE Budhan Nizamshah attacked Bijapur with the help of Sadashivara. At that time Appaji was with the army of Vijayanagara. He showed great bravery in this battle. Bijapur became flood mode. When the commander of Bijapur, Ibrahim Parandi, was in the fort, the Nizamshah and Sadashiv Rai's army were many miles away, but they were sleeping in fear, mistaking the sound of mosquitoes in the forest for the sound of the army's barking, and rode a horse towards Bijapur in a disturbance from the trees.

                            Has escaped. The army of Vijapur was in turmoil. The armies were cut off. Budhan Nizam Shah, on the recommendation of Sadashiv Rai, gave Appaji half of the Kalyanidhya fort under the rule of Mokasa and Tapi. The old estate rights were restored. Asad Kha of Belgaum and Adil Shah of Bijapur were destroyed. Through Asad Khane Appaji, he became friends with the Raya of Vijayanagar. At the invitation of Asad Kha Raya, he went to Vijayanagar with a large army for the Mahanavami celebrations. Ryan was delighted. Torgal and Tungi gave prizes to Astan and Astan. They needed his help against Adil Shah, so Kanoji and Appaji gained weight and importance in Vijayanagar. In Shake 1264, King Viraballal appointed him as the first governor of Karnataka province at Bankapur in the Hariana region. Nandu gave the rights of estate to the Chalukya dynasty. In Shake 1266, the foreign Portuguese sent lawyers to Bankapura as an independent kingdom because of the friendly relations of Somdev with the Ballal king. The Nawab of Hauzawar was paying ransom to them. Later, the Raya of Vijayanagar destroyed the power of the Nawab of Hojavar and appointed a Hindu Amladar. That year made a hero.
