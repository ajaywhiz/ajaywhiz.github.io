                            Although the Mughals secured the temple in the fort of Kalyani, Badoji was saddened by the recapture of the fort, and Khandoji was injured. Kamaloji fought bravely. It seeks to be fully incorporated into Shivaji's sukar along with Bhauband and Apta Vitra. Realizing that Shahaji's internal support was in Shivaji, he took the Jinji Mukami by storm and threatened him. Khandoji was injured in the skirmish that ensued. While Rahu Khan was staying at Bijapur, he worked hard to rescue Shahaji through Muslim and Hindu Umrao from the Deccan Cuttery of Adilshah. Kariyela planned to defeat Shahaji's enemies with the help of Randullah Khan. Pustana Khan became weak. Because Afzal Khan's conspiracy to molest Shahaji was widely reported. Shahaji's son Sambhaji was killed in Saka 1576 after Adil Shah did not help him in time in the battle of Kanakagiri. The following year, Muhammad Adilshah became a prophet. Mughals took advantage of it and took enough land. Khandoji was married to Krishnaji Bhorevi's daughter Bhagavati. He had sons Ramji, Kamaloji, Manaji and Manik Khandoji settled in Vaikuth at Bankapur. Shahaji was very sad.

                            Ramji lived in Navle Patil village near Bhudhargarh fort in Konkan. Mounibuwa used to live there. Above him was his faith. He
considered Mounibuwa and Shivaji as his Guru. Ramji was married to Ramaji Jadhav's sister Lakshmi Bai. After the death of Shivajis Khandoji, Shahaji informed him to visit Watnis and console him. Shivaji went to Patil village to meet Ramjis, before Mau Bua Ramji asked him to do the hard work of bringing the Maratha Sardar from Konkan to Shivaji and Shankar. The Mughal emperor decided the policy of giving Shivajis Bijapurkar and Golcondakar Shah together. Shivaji Maha Mudsadi decided to increase his power by conquering the Konkan Karnataka province and increasing his power by strategizing and taking advantage of the immediate factionalism and internecine strife. As Shahaji was a resident of Kailash, Shivaji tried to get his right in Karnataka. Even Venkoji Adilshah was not willing to willingly give Shivaji's share of Karnataka after the Sardar's warning. Adil Shah had captured part of Konkan Karnataka in Shivaji, he returned. A large Mohit was sent to Kunda province under the army of Iklat Khan to take it. Se Ramvi Bankoji, Shivaji Ghorpade Ghadiyele with the help of Ghans Khana, Vankoji's army included Rathaba Bhaj Koji. Sambhaji Mohit's servant son Babaji Tamji was a pahanira in the army.

                            He had brought with him the wife of the beautiful daughter Santuji to send her home. When Sinwale came to Pargaon, he heard from her that Ramji Savaji Ghorpade had gone back to Mudhol for some time, Ramji immediately sent a letter to Krishnaji Ghadge bidding farewell to Shivaji with horsemen to stay at Parna. After attacking Mudhol in an immediate attack and killing Baji Ghorpadya, he will never come to Konkan. Shivaji attacked the Mughals in 1586. Shahajit was captured at Jinji and took revenge for injuring Khandojira. With immense support from the Mughal army: Krishnaji came into action. His ancestor was an officer in the Purvadhara Chalukya dynasty. For that, he was rewarded outside the village. When Ramji undertook the task of getting Shivajira from the Maratha vassals in the Konkan rift, he was initially unsuccessful. Ramjiya's
brother Kamloji was always riding along with Shivaji, who was a great brave warrior and a complete believer of Shivaji. Back then, the ancient Marathas of Konkan would come under the rule of Adil Shah of Bijapur. Kondaji of Harji and Suryaji Surve Malvani of Shangar and Parbhavanli became disaffected with Ramji of Adilshah who, being their heir, had usurped their lands. Through it, Nilakantha Vatan used to watch Basatur without any hesitation.

                            He was tricked and stabbed. As Adilshah's warning was troubling Shivaji, Ramji informed Kamloji and Shivaji to help him. Shivaji hired Tanaji Malusare to defeat him. Pai attacks Surva before Kamaloji Tanaji joins the ride. Surva's army was defeated by Tanajis, a great warrior. But when Kamaloji came walking with his Bhaiband relative, Tanaji launched a fierce attack. Shivaji came quickly with constant caste. Sushin ran away without giving a damn. At Sangameshwar, the Kamaology Consultancy has appointed Nilakanthara Way Lake Pilagics Officer. Ramji's ancient rights were given back. It was given to Shivajis as the inheritance rights of Brahmins were kept intact. Kalyan's Sawantrao also stopped. The flood from here came under the command of Shivaji. Shivaji sat down on the firanga. Waghoji Shirke, a relative of Ramji, who was entitled to the land in old Konkan, arranged his daughter's marriage with Shivaji, looking after the affairs of Sushya's land. Befriended by Surya and Shivaji, Dalvisi meets Shivaji. Savanta and Goa's firangya was settled by Viramji through Habashi and Ramkotari of Goa, they accepted some rights of Ramji. In the year 1665 AD in Shaka 1587, the battle of Jodilshah of Mughal took place at Mangalvede.
