                            At this time, Shivaji received a religious object of ancient importance from this family. Pila's relationship was strengthened. In 1600 CE, Adil Shah ceded the ancient Mokatta rights of Ramji and his brothers around Bijapur to Ukaran Adi Mokasa and Naik Nadgounda Kiledari rights in Bankapur through the Bijapuri Sardars Sarja Khan and Jamsher Khan to help Shivaji. Dattajipant, Shivaji's official, spread out from the Karnataka region. But in the following year, Adil Shah, fearing the Mughals, signed a treaty with Shivaji. Ramjidhi promised to return so much. After Shivaji, Sambhaji killed Ramji's nephew Somaji and Rayaji in 1602 on suspicion. Somaji was married to Rapa, daughter of Bhoiji Jadhav. Ramji's nephew Nituji Killedar was later married to Hirabai. He lived in a private estate in Karnataka. So they were called Bhojraj Raje. This Ramjeeva Pulta Rawatrao's brother, both as Mansabdars of the Mughals, were getting help from the Umrao of the Mughals to continue the transfer of the land from Kalyani, Badami, Bankapur and Sangameshwar to Goa. Seeing Ramji's character and policy of neutrality, Sambhaji, being Raghoji's nephew, did not disturb him, Sambhaji took over Ramji's cousin Yesuji Khambirarai through the fort of Anjeri and placed his nephew Mahadji in charge of Konkan.

                            This is Ramji's close brotherhood and Talkokan Sangameshwar and Goa's native land. So Sambhaji rode the Portuguese firanga as he was a good weight in that area. It is said that at that time he took special help in negotiating the treaty of Firanga, Rama Kothari used to live in Goa as the Yelji of this family. He maintained good relations with the Portuguese firangi and conducted diplomatic affairs. Sambhaji informs Ramji and Ramji's brothers for friendship with Govekar Firangya. He tried hard to befriend Firangya. A friend and distant relative of Bhojraj, a cousin of Umrao Ramji, a northern Rajput in the service of Mughal Sahebzada Akbar, Bhojrajye married a daughter of the Vala Chavan clan in Malwa and received a large fortune from her father-in-law. He gave loans as ruqa to the Mughal Umrahs in the south. He was a renowned warrior and intelligent and knew many languages. Pratising with his relative Shahzada Akbar he came to the south and later remained in the army of Sambhaji's kingdom, Ramji Bhoj Raja's nephew, Tikayat Mahagun, Kiyati Singh, and the Rajputs of the north, were addressed as unemployed. Being the heir of an ancient dynasty, he was held in high esteem. As his special respect to the Portuguese Firangi did not return Ramji's ancient rights and Sansthan village appointment time, with the help of Ramji and Sambhaji, he decided to restore his rights from Firangya. Sambhaji's lawyer Raoji Pandit did the delicate and important work of Goa without cleverness.

                            In Shake 1603 Sambhaji tried to negotiate with the Govekars on the advice of Raja Ramji. But the Firangyas did not sign a treaty as the Firangi Chalakh Yetuji was not given enough authority. There was a priest with him. He was first met by Ramji Navale at Patgaon and urged him to go to Raigadara, the treaty talks broke down, the campaign was stopped, the negotiations were turned around and Ramji's cousin Sidojit rushed to Goa from Sambhaji and was imprisoned by the Firangis. The agreement was reached. The Goyas in
this holding were shocked. Ram Kothari excelled. It was hard to know where to kick the ball. Ramjipa's brother Kamaloji used to ride with Shivaji on important occasions. Shivaji destroyed the power of Chandra Rao Maurya. The small fingers of this fairy from Konkan stand under the umbrella of Bijapur as Marathas. Harji and Suryaji Sarve of Subhgapatta Pradhanvali and Dalvi of Panvel had disaffected Ramji with Adilshah, and because of this, he deceived and killed Ramjiya Karta Nilkantrao, who stole his ancient rights around Sangameshwar. Gurve and Dalvi were giving way to Shivaji with Adilshah's warning and instigation. As his forces could not gather in Konkan, Ramji decided to defeat Kamalogji with the help of Shivaji.

                            Again Sushya's army was defeated because of that, Kamalji came together with his brothers and relatives and launched a strong attack again, Shivaji Sushyartha, who was coming with his own caste and haste, wrote the letter without delay. Lake Pilajis Kamaloji of Nilkanwarao assigned the rights of Sangameshwaray and made Ramji's predecessor entitled. Shivajis got rid of the Brahmin priest's right to Badarpur. Palva's Yashwantrayan Palva was also acquitted and released. The bad thorn of Western Konkan should be included in Shivaji's Swaraj. Ramji was credited with winning Shivaji's favor as a Maratha chieftain in Konkan. But it was not to be carried out in open opposition to Adil Shah and the Mughals. His ancient right of Ramji was under the power of Adil Shah and Mughals. Knowing that it was necessary to keep them safe, he had to be very clever to perform in Konkan, so he cleverly befriended the local Maratha Surve with Shivaji. Surya's ancient relative, who was overseeing the system of Jagirdari, married his son Shivaji. As Ramji's relatives, they joined Shivaji's party thinking that they were brothers. Sawantas and Firangyas of Goa became friends. At that time Ramaji Kothari Hubshi played an important role in NOTAPA, seeing the strong support of the Marathas, he had to make a treaty with them.
